## 🚀 What I'm Up To

🔬 **Current Research**: Working on aging prediction using large-scale health datasets (CLSA, All of Us, BLSA) under Prof. Yu Sun's mentorship at USF. Exploring how intrinsic capacity impacts functional ability in older adults - because data has the power to change lives!

🎯 **Goal**: Seeking SWE internship opportunities where I can bring my research mindset and collaborative spirit to build amazing products. I aim to build experience and am willing to work unpaid as a volunteer , provided the project is impacting people in a positive way.
